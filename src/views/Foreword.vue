            I’ve come to understand four things about Gundam EXVS over the six
            years in which I’ve played it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The game is incredibly easy to play, at least on a basic
              mechanical level.
            </li>
            <li>
              The game itself teaches you
              <span class="red font-italic">very</span> little about
              <span class="red font-italic">how</span> to play it, other than
              basic buttons.
            </li>
            <li>
              In most fighting games, the input complexity wall and the tactical
              application wall is practically interlinked. In order to do well
              in something like Marvel, you have to physically learn all kinds
              of combo execution techniques and timings, and usually, the more
              complex those strings are, the more agency you can exert, and thus
              the more you can control the flow of the match. <br />
              Gundam EXVS is not like that. The input complexity wall is very
              low, high-level input complexity isn’t much tougher. However, the
              application ceiling is functionally infinite.
            </li>
            <li>
              The reason people can play this game for years and still get
              washed by series veterans is pretty simple: there’s so much going
              on under the hood that
              <span class="text-info font-italic font-weight-bold"
                >you probably don’t know what you don’t know</span
              >, meaning that if you’re unaware that these micro-mechanics
              exist, it’s very difficult - if not near-impossible - to figure
              out how they’re supposed to be used, especially on your own.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I saw the upcoming release of Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Versus Maxi
            Boost ON (MBON from here on out), and thought to myself, “this game
            deserves to succeed and become a staple of the Western FGC.” I knew
            there would be a lot of new and returning players that would push
            through the frustration like I did, but there's also players that
            will give up out of frustration because the game doesn’t explain how
            to bend its rules very well.
          </p>
          <p>What could be done to stop this from happening?</p>
          <p>
            The answer to that question is the guide you’re reading right now:
            built by multiple members of the Gundam EXVS community, with some
            extremely experienced hands contributing the equivalent of literal
            decades worth of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="red font-weight-bold"
              >Our goal is to teach you the game’s core concepts in successive
              stages</span
            >. Each new section acts as a logical extension of the prior
            section, with the aim of helping players of any skill level grow,
            and, to eventually strengthen their ability to solve any situational
            problem a match can and will present to a player.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combine this with the
            <span class="text-info"
              >right mindset - one in which losses
              <span class="red">are not</span> a reflection of your
              potential</span
            >
            as a player but are merely
            <span class="text-info">lessons to be learned</span> from, where
            <span class="text-info"
              >winning <span class="red">only validates</span> the work</span
            >
            you already put into your own self-improvement as a player - and it
            can take you much further and much faster than it would trying to
            figure it all out on your own.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will still need to
            <span class="text-info"><u>actively practice</u></span> these
            concepts and implement them into your playstyle. As you do that,
            you’ll notice a distinct improvement in your play and a greater
            sense of understanding as you continue through this guide. It will
            grant you the freedom to express yourself in-game to a degree that
            no other fighting game I’ve played has really ever managed to
            achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to the most fun game on the planet Earth. I hope you fall in
            love just as hard as I have.
